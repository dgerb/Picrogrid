This is the software code base for all hardware in the Picrogrid ecosystem. The subdirectories are organized as:

(a) Picrogrid Boards - C++ code base to run on the ATmega microcontroller present on every Picrogrid board. The subdirectories include instructional readme files, example code for each board, and API library files for each board.

(b) Raspberry Pi - Python code base to run on a Raspberry Pi that manages one or more Picrogrid boards. The subdirectories include example code and setup scripts.
